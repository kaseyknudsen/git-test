<!-- img is a void element
it requires a src attribute: path to image file
common rule of thumb is to use JPG for images & PNG for digitally created graphics
always use an alt attribute for 
1)accessibility
2)if image cannot be loaded, the text will show instead
3)helps search engines to get more info about your webpage-->
<img src="images/ext-icon.png" alt="Photo of a dog"/>

<!-- <img> width & height attributes 
<img src="someImage.jpg" alt="Photo of a dog" width="200" height="100"/>
dimensions are in px, but you don't type px into the value.
If you only type either width or height, the browser will default to the original ratio

<!-- video element 
    new in HTML5
    <video src="someVideo.mp4" controls>
    video element supports MP4, OGG, WEBM
    text between the start and end tag is called 'fallback content'. It's useful is someone's browser doesn't support video:
    <video src="someVideo.mp4" controls>Your browser does not support HTML5 Video. Here is <a href="SomeVideo.mp4>a link to
    the video instead.</video>
    *controls is a boolean attribute. Not required, but it will cause the video controls to show up within the embedded video.
    *you can specify the width and height
    *boolean attribute 'loop' causes the video to replay after it finishes
    *don't use autoplay
