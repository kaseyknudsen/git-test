    CSS Ruleset/Rule. 'p' is the selector. It can be used with any html element. everything inside the curly braces makes up
    the 'declaration block'
    Selector
    Declaration Block
    Declaration
    property name/property
    property value/value

    this is a CSS 'ruleset' or 'rule':
      p (p is the 'selector'){
          color: blue; (this is the declaration. color is the property name, blue is the property value)
      }

      There are 3 ways to add CSS: External stylesheets, internal stylesheets & inline styles

      External stylesheet is recommended!

      CSS rulesets written inside text doc with .css extension
      In HTML doc, add <link> element inside <head>: <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />
        'rel' stands for relationship. Always set this to 'stylesheet'
        for href attribute, provide path to external stylesheet

        *this css path can be to a local file, or to stylesheet hosted elsewhere on the web, often on a CDN (content delivery network).
        For example:
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" />

  Internal stylesheet:
        use <style> element inside HTML doc's <head>. Write CSS rulesets inside the <style> element:
          <style>
            p{
              color: red;
            }
          </style>

  Inline Styles:
          use 'style' attribute in an html element to directly apply a style. Write CSS declarations inside the style attribute's value:
          <p style="color:red;">This text will be red.</p>

  **avoid inline styles and internal stylesheets for 2 main reasons:
          1) Harder to maintain/update/organize
          2)They can only apply to a single webpage; external stylesheet can be applied to unlimited number of webpages

  * 3 primary kinds of selectors: element/type, class, id
          **this is an element selector:
          p {
              color: red;
            }
          **this is called a class selector (the period is also known as a 'full class' character). CSS relies heavily on class selectors
          because they are the most flexible and reusable.
          .text-primary {
            color: red;
          }
          <h1 class="text-primary"> this text will be red.<h1>
          <p class="text-primary">this text will be red too.</p>
          
          **this is an ID selector. Create an id selector with a # followed by the id name. Each id name can only be used once per
          html document. Use ID selectors sparingly. Classes are preferred.
          #copyright {
            font-size: 12px;
          }

  **Class vrs. ID attribute**
          main difference: classes can be applied to multiple elements; ids should be used as a unique identifier on only one element
          in the document. Be careful not to name 2 ids the same thing. If you do, the browser will not warn you and ignore all but
          the first element when you target that id

    *
    .text-primary {
      color:red;
    }
    .bg-primary {
      background: black;
    }
    You can set multiple classes on the same element. Then set both on the same element to combine the rules, separate with a space:
    <p class="text-primary bg-primary">This text will be red with a black background.</p>

  **Color values
    -all modern browsers support a set of 140 standard color names
    -search for 'color picker'
    -in VS code, hover over the color picker to get the hex value you are looking for

**Span element
  -non-semantic, in-line HTML element with no default meaning or style. Use as a hook for a class or ID without any unwanted side effects.    
    you can use it for just pieces of text, or in the middle of a sentence:
    <p> I wish some of this text was <span class='red-text'>colored red</span></p>
