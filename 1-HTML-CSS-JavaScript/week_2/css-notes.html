<!-- dashes mean that there are no values set in the css box model -->
<!-- paragraph has extra margins set by default -->

<!-- shorthand property:
    margin:
        div {
            margin-top: 10px;
            margin-right: 5px;
            margin-bottom: 4px;
            margin-left: auto;
        }
    *this can be written shorthand as follows (it will apply them in clockwise order):
    div {
        margin: 10px 5px 4px auto;
    }

    *if you give two values, the values will go (1st value=top/bottom, 2nd value=left/right):
        div {
            margin: 5px 10px;
        }

    *if you give one value, it's the equivalent of setting all the margins to that value
    give on
        div {
            margin: 5px;
        }

    *how to horizontally center an element:
    div {
        margin: auto;
    }

    If the margin property has three values:

        margin: 10px 5px 15px;
        top margin is 10px
        right and left margins are 5px
        bottom margin is 15px

-->

<!-- CSS Padding:

    works similar to margin:
    div {
        padding-top: 5px;
        padding-right: 10px;
        padding-bottom: 20px;
        padding-left: 30px;
      }
      shorthand would be: 
      div {
          padding; 5px 10px 20px 30px;
      }
    -->

    <!-- CSS Border properties:
    
        div {
            border-color: blue;
            border-style: solid;
            border-width: 5px;
        }
        shorthand (border-style is required, the other 2 are optional. The order of values does not matter):
        div {
            border: blue solid 5px;
        }
        *border-style is required. allowed values include: solid, dotted, dashed, double & more. The default border-style is 'none'. If you
        enter the other properties without border-style, they won't show up.
    -->

    <!-- Background common properties:
        div{
            background-color: green;
            background-image: url("strawberry.jpg");
            background-size: 100px;
            background-position: center;
            background-repeat: repeat-x;
            height: 200px;
        } 
    shorthand (order doesn't matter, unless you are using position & size. They must be joined with a slash, with position first): div {
        background: green url("strawberry.jpg") center/100px repeat-x;
    }
    
    -->

    <!-- Font properties:
        div{
            font-style: italic;
            font-size: 18px
            font-weight: bold;
            font-family: Cambria, Georgia, serif;
        }
        Shorthand: div {
            font: italic 18px bold Cambria, Georgia, serif;
        }
            * font-family should contain multiple fonts, comma separated & in order of preference, in case preferred font is not available.
            Always provide a generic font e.g. serif or sans-serif as a final fallback font.

            * When using the font shorthand property, both font-size and font-family are required; the others are optional. The font family
            must be set last; aside from this, the order of values doesn't matter

    -->

    <!-- Display property is one of the most important properties in CSS for layout (no shorthand)
        most common are:
        display: block;
        display: inline;
        display: inline-block;
        display: none;

        *Elements with display: block; element begins on a new line and can be given width & height properties
        *Elements with display: inline; elements will stay on the same line and cannot be given width & heights properties
        *Elements with display: inline-block; will stay on the same line but can accept width & height properties
        *Elements with display: none; elements are not shown

    <!-- color, opacity, width & height, text-align
        -color sets the text color
        -opacity sets the element opacity. Set opacity between 0 & 1 %. 0% is completely transparent, 1% is completely apparent, .1% is 10% 
        -width & height can be px or % or auto
            width: 10px;    height: 10px;
            width: 50%;     height: 50%;
            width: auto;    height: auto;
            **number & unit (e.g. px; can omit unit is number is 0). No space between 10px. Not 10 px. Auto lets browser figure it out.
        -text align: set alignment of text in an element
            text-align: left;
            text-align: right;
            text-align: center;
            text-align: justify;

    <!-- the cascade: specificity and selectors Part 1:
    
        THe "C" in CSS: One HTML page can have many different sources for styles: multiple external style sheets. an internal style sheet, inline
        styles. user-agent stylesheet (browser defaults), user stylesheet.

        To understand the algorithm, you have to understand CSS specificity
        -inline styles have the highest level of specificity of all selectors, and IDs beat everything else (2nd highest level of specificity). Class is next (3rd).
        Element is the least specific.
        -the placement of the CSS link in the html page is important to the algorithm. If you place it above the style element, it will read the the internal 
        style sheet. If you put the CSS link below the style element, it will read the external style sheet:

        Example 1: The color will be red
        <title>CSS specificity demo</title>
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: blue;
            }
        </style>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"/> (color is red)

        Example 2: The color will be blue
        <title>CSS specificity demo</title>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"/> (color is red)
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: blue;
            }
        </style>

        -if there are rule-sets that conflict with each other, the last one that is read will win. The other properties will still be read.

<!-- HTML File looks like this -->
<!-- 
    <div style="background: yellow" class="bg-red" id="bg-green>"
    </div>


 -->
<!-- CSS File looks like this: -->
<!-- div {
    background: blue;   **element/type selector
} 
.bg-red {
    background: red;    **class selector**
}
#bg-green {
    background: green;  **ID selector
}
-->

<!-- Specificity Point Values -->
    <!-- INline Styles: 1000
    ID selector: 100
    Class selector: 10
    Element/type selector: 1 -->


    <!-- The Cascade: specificity and selectors Part 2: 
    -grouping selectors
    -psudeo-classes
    -attribute selectors
    -combinators
    -more on specificity point values
    -CSS inheritance
    
    Apply the same ruleset to multiple selectors at once. Write each selector on same line, comma separated:
    h1, #id1, .class1 {
        background: green;
    }
    
    Pseudo-classes: use pseudo classes to narrow down elements to those in a particular state. Not used on their own,
    but attached to other selectors
    Syntax: selector:pseudo-class
    div:hover - selects div currently being hovered over
    input:focus - selects input currently in focus
    a:visited - selects all anchor links that have been previously clicked on

    Attribute selectors
    -choose elements based on what attributes they contain
    -specify attribute name only, or include the value
    -don't exist on their own, are attached to another selector
    Syntax: selector[attribute]
        Example: div[lang] - selects all div elements with a lang attribute
                 input[type="submit"] - selects input element with a type of "submit" only
                 .my-class[required]

    Combinators
    -descendant selector (space)
        form div (this will only select div elements that are inside form elements)
        <form>
            <fieldset>
                <div>...</div>
            </fieldset>
        </form>
    -child selector (>)
        body > h1 (will only select elements that are direct children of the body element)
        <body>
            <h1>...<h1>
        </body>
    -adjacent sibling selector (+)
        p + img (only will select <img> elements that come right after a <p> element)
    -general sibling selector (~)
        p ~ img (will select any img elements that come after the <p> element, but not necessarily right after)
            <p></P>
            <div></div>
            <img/>

    (12 points) form > input[required] input:focus (11 points)-->

    <!-- CSS inheritance:
        Some (not all) CSS properties are inherited from the parent element to child elements. IN this example, span will inherit color, but not border
        <div>
            HTML:
            <span>what color is this text?</span>
            CSS:
            div {
                color: blue;
                border: 2px black;
            }
        </div>

    <!-- general rule, more general ones should be toward the to and more specific should
    be toward the bottom 

    absolute: position of relative or absolute

    use percentages or REM when possible
