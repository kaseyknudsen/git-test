    <!-- the form element formally defines it's contents as a form -->

    <!-- action attribute: URL on a server that should run a server-side script (a small program) to handle the form submission -->
    <!-- method attribute: can be set to "get" or "post". Get is used to send requests for data from a server, such as a search query. It
        is inherently insecure. Post is used to send data to the server, both text and binary data such as images, any sensitive data that needs to be encrypted such as 
         passwords-->

<!-- input attributes:
type: text, submit, many others
name: required, single word, tells server what the data is. If you don't put a name, the input will be ignored
value: default value to submit, also used for submit button text
placeholder: appears in the field, but doesn't set the value of the field. It's 'hint' text to user about what to enter
required: boolean, inputs with this attribute must be given a value before the form can be submitted-->

checkbox
radio -->

all the inputs in the group, but they should have a different value-->

<!-- fieldset & legend are useful for giving structure to the contents of a form. Fieldset is used to group sets of form controls
together (input is an example of a form control). <legend> is used to set a caption at the top of a <fieldset>-->

        <legend>Your Information</legend>
        <input type="text" name="firstname" placeholder="Your first name" required>

    <!-- select & option elements: used together to create a dropdown list.
        similar to how ol/ul & li work together. select element much have a 'name' attribute. Each option element should have a value attribute -->

    <!-- label: surround a form control's caption text in a <label> element. Associate the label and form control by giving the label a 'for' attribute
        and the form control an id attribute, then set their values to match. Then if the label is click or touched, the associated form control will 
    become focused - easier to hit and more accessible. If you don't have a <label> element, clicking on the text will do nothing. -->
        <label for="firstName">First Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" />
