<!-- the div element, short for division, used as a generic container of other elements. It can hold
almost anything inside the body - text, images, video, etc, even other <div>s.
It is non-semantic, meaning it has no inherent meaning. It doesn't give you any clue
as to what is inside it. Ideally use semantic elements whenever possible and <div> as last
    recourse-->

<!-- <p> element is used to contain text. By default, it is displayed with extra top and 
    bottom margins.
you can not nest <p> inside another <p> -->

<!-- <section> element is similar to the <div> element, but it is semantic, e.g. new releases
    section of a movie theater's homepage.
It's not required, but it typically contains a header element inside it. -->

<!-- <h1> - <h6> 6 levels of headings. It should not be used to resize text. CSS should be used for
    resizing text. H tags should be used to structure content meaningfully-->

<!-- <ol>, <ul>, <li>
<ol> = ordered list
<ul> = unordered list
<li> = used to define each list item-->

<!-- <ol>
    <li>coconuts</li>
    <li>mangos</li>
    <li>bananas</li>
</ol> -->

<!-- <em> & <strong> ...<em> & <strong> are 'inline' elements, meaning they don't start a new line
    <em> =  italics/emphasis
        <strong> display as bold-->

<!-- block level means it will start a new line -->
