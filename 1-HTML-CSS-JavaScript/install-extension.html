<!-- a block level element is separated by space in CSS... {display: block;} -->
<!-- http://127.0.0.1:5500/install-extension.html is the loopback address. Local IP address that's
only on my local computer -->
<!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document. -->
