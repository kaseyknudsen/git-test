Math.random()
Math.floor()

Math is a built-in global object in JS that we can use to access certain math-related functions, which are called methods of the Math
global object

Math is always capitalized

generates a random number between 0 & 1:
let randomNumber = Math.random();
*this includes 0, but does not include 1

To generate a number between 0 - 6, but not including 6:
let randomNumber = Math.random() * 6
-this might return 3.029064879261344

use floor to remove decimals

const anInteger = Math.floor(3.14);
-returns just the number to the left

const randomInt = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
-will return a random integer between 0 & 6 (not including 6)

this will include 6...
const randomInt = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
